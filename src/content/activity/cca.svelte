	<p>
		In 2024, I was chosen to be the president of my school Infocomm Club, a position that is not
		given out easily. I was chosen for my leadership skills, and my ability to work with others. As
		the president, I am responsible for my executive committee, and committee members, ensuring that
		they work on their assigned tasks. Throughout my time, I have made many presentations,
		especially during Open House, where I presented to parents and students about the club, and what
		we do. I also had to plan events such as CCA orientation, ensuring that manpower was used
		efficiently, and that everything was in order.
	</p>
	<p>
		One thing I had to work on, and am proud of, is the CCA T-shirt. As part of my duties, I had to
		redesign the CCA T-shirt, which was a challenge as I had never designed a T-shirt before. After
		many iterations and feedback from the teacher-in-charge and my art teacher, I had finally come
		up with an amazing design, and liaised with T-shirt vendors to find the most affordable and
		quality T-shirt for the new club members.
	</p>
	<p>
		Being the president of Infocomm Club has taught me many things, such as leadership, teamwork,
		and communication skills. Through the CCA, I have joined many different competitions and learnt
		how to manage my time well, as I had to balance my studies and CCA activities. I am really
		grateful for the opportunity to lead and serve.
