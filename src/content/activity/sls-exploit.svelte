	<p>
		In 2021, I discovered a vulnerability in the Student Learning Space (SLS) platform used by
		students in Singapore. The exploit allowed me to access the result of the poll without needing
		to submit an answer. While this was not a major issue, as it is just a poll, it demonstrates my
		ability to identify and exploit vulnerabilities in web applications.
	</p>
	<p>
		I reported this vulnerability to GovTech through hackerone, and they acknowledged the issue.
		Over the next few weeks, I worked with them to provide more details. Through submitting the
		report, I managed to get a C01N from them.
